## 1. Business Requirement Document (BRD) - Initial Client Discovery

### Executive Summary
The client seeks a comprehensive learning management system that serves three distinct user personas: **Students** (course discovery & live attendance), **Teachers** (content delivery & classroom management), and **Admins** (platform oversight & user management). This multi-stakeholder ecosystem requires careful requirement gathering to ensure each user journey is optimized while maintaining system cohesion.

### Key Discovery Questions Framework

**Business Context & Vision**
- What specific pain points does your current learning delivery method face?
- How do you currently handle live class scheduling and student capacity management?
- What's your target student-to-teacher ratio per session?
- Do you have existing content libraries or integration requirements with third-party educational tools?

**Technical Infrastructure & Scale**
- What's your anticipated user base (students/teachers) in Year 1 vs Year 3?
- Do you require multi-language support or region-specific compliance (FERPA, GDPR)?
- What's your current technology stack, and are there any mandatory integrations (payment gateways, identity providers)?
- Do you need offline capability for mobile users in low-connectivity areas?

**Business Model & Monetization**
- Is this a subscription-based, pay-per-course, or institutional licensing model?
- How do you currently handle payment processing and subscription management?
- Do teachers receive revenue sharing, and if so, what reporting capabilities are needed?

**Success Metrics & Acceptance Criteria**
- What constitutes a successful live class session (attendance rates, engagement metrics)?
- How do you measure student progress and course completion?
- What administrative dashboards and reports are critical for day-one operations?

This structured discovery ensures we capture both functional requirements (what the system must do) and non-functional requirements (how it must perform), creating a solid foundation for accurate scope and timeline estimation.
