## Phone Number Management

### Overview
The Phone Number Management module provides comprehensive control over telephony endpoints, including configuration, status monitoring, and workflow attachment.

### Adding New Phone Numbers

**Required Information:**
- **Phone Number**: Complete international format (e.g., +01246745747)
- **Label**: Descriptive identifier for easy recognition
- **Provider**: Service provider selection (SAN, Twilio, etc.)
- **Status**: Active/Inactive toggle

**Configuration Process:**
1. Navigate to "Phone Numbers" in sidebar
2. Click "Add New Number"
3. Complete required fields
4. Configure message settings
5. Save and activate

### Message Configuration

#### First Message (Greeting)
The initial audio prompt callers hear upon connection.

**Best Practices:**
- Keep under 30 seconds
- Clearly identify your organization
- Provide brief menu options if applicable
- Example: "Welcome to Acme Corporation. How may I assist you today?"

#### Fallback Message
Automated response when the system cannot interpret caller input.

**Recommended Approach:**
- Polite acknowledgment of confusion
- Simple rephrasing request
- Alternative contact method if needed
- Example: "I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your request?"

#### Wait Time Configuration
Duration (in seconds) before triggering fallback responses or transitioning between workflow nodes.

**Optimization Guidelines:**
- Standard wait time: 3-5 seconds
- Extended wait for complex queries: 8-12 seconds
- Immediate response for simple confirmations: 1-2 seconds

### Workflow Attachment
Numbers can be associated with multiple workflows through the Phone Number Details interface:

1. Select target phone number
2. Access "Phone Number Details" tab
3. Click "Attach Workflow"
4. Choose from available workflows
5. Configure priority and conditions

- Basic routing

#### Conditional Workflows
Logic-driven processes with multiple paths, suitable for:
- Customer service routing
- Technical support escalation
- Dynamic content delivery
- Time-based responses

#### Integration Workflows
API-connected processes for:
- CRM data retrieval
- Order status checking
- Account verification
- External system updates

### Workflow Development Process

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Define customer journey objectives
   - Map decision points and outcomes
   - Identify required integrations
   - Establish success metrics

2. **Design Phase**

   - Select appropriate node types
   - Configure conditional logic
   - Test path scenarios

3. **Implementation Phase**
   - Build workflow in platform
   - Configure API connections
   - Set up error handling
   - Implement logging and analytics

4. **Testing Phase**
   - Conduct end-to-end testing
   - Validate all decision paths
   - Test edge cases and errors
   - Performance optimization

5. **Deployment Phase**
   - Attach to phone numbers
