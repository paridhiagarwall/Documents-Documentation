# AI Voice and Chat Dashboard Document

This comprehensive handbook contains all essential information for Admin users of the platform, including dashboard operations, QA responsibilities, project workflows, and company policies. This document is designed for independent learning without requiring external explanation.

***

## 1. Dashboard Access \& User Management

### Dashboard Environments (Login URLs)

- **Staging Environment:** https://auth-staging.liaplus.com/auth/login
Used for testing features before they go live in production.
- **Production Environment:** https://auth.liaplus.com/auth/login
Used for all everyday work and live operations.


### User Roles \& Access Permissions

- **SuperAdmin:** Possesses global rights with unrestricted access to all organizations and assistants in the system. Can manage, modify, and oversee everything across the platform.
- **Admin:** Has limited access to only the organizations and assistants specifically assigned by the SuperAdmin. Cannot view or manage assistants or organizations without explicit permission.

**Important Note:** Before raising any access-related issues, verify with your SuperAdmin whether you have been granted the necessary permissions for that specific assistant or organization. This prevents time wastage for all team members.
